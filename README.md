# CPA Web App Project
![GitHub Background](GitHubBackground.jpg)
## Objective

Build a web application that helps CPA candidates score highly on the IT portion of the BEC exam.

## What Is the Problem?

The AICPA, the organization responsible for creating the CPA exams, started to include more IT questions in their BEC test. Many people who take the CPA are not prepared for these questions because IT topics are not covered adequately in existing review courses. Because of this, many people are struggling with the BEC portion of the CPA exam.

## How Can I Use the Application?
